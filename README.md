Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their
	• visiting patterns,
	• how much money they’ve spent, and
	• which menu items are their favorite.
Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalized experience for his loyal customers.
He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program — additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.
The data set contains the following 3 tables which you may refer to the relationship diagram below to understand the connection.
	• sales
	• members
  • menu
